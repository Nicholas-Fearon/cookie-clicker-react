Reflecting on the project, I’m particularly pleased with how the app aligns with both the core requirements and the stretch goals, as well as the development practices used to achieve them. This experience has significantly strengthened my React development skills, particularly with using useState and useEffect for responsive state management and real-time updates in the game.

Implementing useState and useEffect allowed the app to handle user interactions smoothly, manage cookies per second (cps), and keep the game updated in real-time. By setting up setInterval in useEffect, cookies automatically increase every second, offering users the satisfaction of watching their progress unfold continuously. Including a cleanup function in useEffect helped manage memory efficiently, preventing unnecessary intervals from stacking up.

For project organisation, creating separate component files helped to keep the code modular and manageable. By moving JSX into components such as Header, CookieCounter, CookieButton, UpgradeButton, and ResetButton, I ensured that each part of the app was logically separated, which made the code more maintainable and easier to read. Additionally, using .map() to render upgrade items meant I could add or modify upgrades in the database without needing to adjust the rendering logic, keeping the app both dynamic and efficient.

To manage upgrades, I added logic that disables upgrade buttons when the user has insufficient cookies, providing clear feedback on what’s achievable within the game. I also integrated an API with Supabase to fetch upgrade information and used SQL to structure the database, which was both a rewarding challenge and a practical solution. Supabase made it easy to retrieve upgrade data and allowed me to centralise this part of the app’s logic in the backend.

To ensure user progress was preserved, I used local storage to save and retrieve game state, meaning cookies and cps were saved between sessions. The addition of a Reset button lets users restart the game and reset all stored data, improving replayability and meeting a key stretch goal of providing a consistent game experience across multiple sessions.

One of the enhancements I’m particularly proud of is the addition of sounds for the upgrade and reset buttons. This small but impactful feature adds to the user experience, giving immediate auditory feedback when users interact with these buttons. It helps make the app feel more engaging and immersive, providing a richer, more dynamic interaction.

While basic UI styling was applied, I recognise there is still potential to enhance the visual design further. More advanced styling could improve the game’s overall appeal and make it more intuitive, and this is an area I plan to revisit to deliver the best possible user experience.

In summary, this project has been an insightful journey through state management, real-time updates, componentisation, data persistence, backend integration, and user experience enhancements such as sound feedback. Meeting the core and stretch requirements has created a strong foundation for future improvements and additional features.
